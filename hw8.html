			Hi, I'm Thomas and this is my first website for CS 132. I'm taking this 
			class as a part of the CNIT A.S. degree to get a job working in IT.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have a full time job. When I'm not there or doing classwork, my 
			favorite thing is to spend time with friends, family, and my girlfriend.
							
			<p> And here is a list of my favorite hobbies: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Ultimate Football</li>
				<li>Electronic Music</li>
				<li>No Limit Texas Hold'em</li>
			</ol>
